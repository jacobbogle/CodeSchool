                    <b>Some people ARE illegal.</b><br><br>

                    <b>Lobizonas do NOT exist.</b><br><br>

                    Manuela Azul has been crammed into an existence that feels too small for her. As an undocumented immigrant who's on the run from her father's Argentine crime-family, Manu is confined to a small apartment and a small life in Miami, Florida.<br><br>
                    
                    Until Manu's protective bubble is shattered.<br><br>
                    
                    Her surrogate grandmother is attacked, lifelong lies are exposed, and her mother is arrested by ICE. Without a home, without answers, and finally without shackles, Manu investigates the only clue she has about her past--a mysterious "Z" emblem—which leads her to a secret world buried within our own. A world connected to her dead father and his criminal past. A world straight out of Argentine folklore, where the seventh consecutive daughter is born a bruja and the seventh consecutive son is a lobizón, a werewolf. A world where her unusual eyes allow her to belong. <br><br>
                    
                    As Manu uncovers her own story and traces her real heritage all the way back to a cursed city in Argentina, she learns it's not just her U.S. residency that's illegal. . . .it's her entire existence.

            So stay tuned...<br><br>
            For now warm up by the campfire and read the book we are all reading this month. Have a look at some of the books we like. Or if your on a computer and not a phone or tablet, play some retro games in our Arcade!
